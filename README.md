# sra_fetch
GUI app for downloading whole SRA series or individual and metadata. Additional options for uploading to S3.

How to Use
===
This is still in development so download the git.
From within the sra_fetch folder:

```
python3 sra_fetch/SRA_downloader.py
```
This will launch the GUI. Provide the GSE or GSM number from GEO and choose the directory to download and provide the email so NCBI knows who is downloading. 

Will update soon.
